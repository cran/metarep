Description: User-friendly package for reporting replicability-analysis methods, affixed to meta-analyses summary. This package implements the methods introduced in Jaljuli et. al. (2022) <doi:10.1080/19466315.2022.2050291>. The replicability-analysis output provides an assessment of the investigated intervention, where it offers quantification of effect replicability and assessment of the consistency of findings.
 - Replicability-analysis for fixed-effects and random-effect meta analysis: 
 - r(u)-value;
 - lower bounds on the number of studies with replicated positive and\or negative effect;
 - Allows detecting inconsistency of signals;
 - forest plots with the summary of replicability analysis results;
 - Allows Replicability-analysis with or without the common-effect assumption.
